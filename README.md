# 🚀 Vanilla Autoencoder from Scratch

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Vanilla Autoencoder**, covering its architecture, theory, and real-world applications. Learn how to compress and reconstruct data using deep learning with step-by-step code and explanations!

## 📖 What is a Vanilla Autoencoder?
A **Vanilla Autoencoder** is a neural network designed to learn efficient data representations in an unsupervised manner. It consists of two main components:

- **Encoder**: Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.

Autoencoders are widely used for **dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, anomaly detection, and data denoising**.
